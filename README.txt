PHPLiteAdmin (PLA) is alpha software, and should not be used by anyone who is 
not brave, or does not know what effect this software may have on their system.

You must download and install PHP 5.1.0 or better, if not already done so.
You can download PHP from here, http://www.php.net/downloads.php

You must ensure that the PDO extention is running. By defalt PDO supports the
SQLite extention, but you should make sure that this is active by going into 
your php.ini file and making sure that line "extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll" is
not commented out. This will ensure that you can make SQLite databases at will.
